A collection of publicly available HSV Packs I made.

## Better Electrostats HSVs
#### Changes from original HSVs:
- "+++++" text only appears when you hit a perfect 115. (No underswing)
- Underswing indicators appear when you swing only just one point of underswing.
- Removed "TDPRO" HSV and added TD varients of strict HSVs that have the same time dependance judgements as "TDPRO".
- Slight changes to sizes of texts.
- Added more "ElectroInvisible" HSVs and also fixed incorrect percentages in the names.
- Reworked colours of "ElectoInvisible" HSVs
- Strict TD shows red at 0.9 TD instead of 1.
- Made "ElectrostatsCHEATS" align more with the rest of the HSVs
- Other minor fixes
